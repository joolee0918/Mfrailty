Title: Dependence multivariate random effects model via gaussian copula functions
Version: 0.1
Authors: Jooyoung Lee and Richard J. Cook
Description: Maximum likelihood estimation for a multivariate mixed-Poisson model with the dependence by type-specific random effects via copula functions. The Expectiation-Maximaization algorithm is used for semiparametric model. Frailty distributions including the gamma, and log-normal are supported, and Gaussian copula function is supported for dependence modeling. Parametric model is also supported including exponential, weibull model.
